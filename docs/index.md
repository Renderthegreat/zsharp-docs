# Z# Programming Language

A low-level, high-efficiency programming language built for speed, structure, and simplicity.
Modular by design. Minimal by nature. Made for power users and precision coding.


- ## 🧠 Minimal & Explicit
    Z# starts with just `byte`, `null`, and `void` types. Everything else is added via modular features.
- ## 🚀 High Performance
    Built with control in mind — customizable garbage collection, no bloat. You write what you mean.
- ## 🏗️ Modular Language
    Extend the language with custom features, types, and syntax — all opt-in and strictly defined.
- ## 🧩 Built for Integration
    details: Designed to compile into any backend — C, WebAssembly, native binaries, and more.
- ## 📦 Lightweight Packages
    Use the `zap` crate manager to install, share, and build apps and libraries with minimal overhead.
- ## 📚 Educational & Practical
    Designed to teach system-level concepts while staying productive in real-world projects.
