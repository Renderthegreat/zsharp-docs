# Hello, World!

Letâ€™s write your first Z# program â€” the classic **Hello, World!**.

## Step 1: Create a File

Create a new file called `main.zs`:

```sh
touch main.zs
```

## Step 2: Write the code

Paste the following code into `main.zs`

```zsharp
import 'z#';

Console.log('Hello, World!');

Process.exit(0);
```

<Badge type="tip" text="Donâ€™t worry about the syntax for now â€” weâ€™ll cover it in the next section." />

## Step 3: Run the Program

Run:

```sh
zs run main.zs
```

You should see:
`Hello, World!`

ðŸŽ‰ That's it â€” youâ€™ve just written your first Z# program!
